                the prices can be quite expensive.
                <br>
                If you're looking for an artist in Kenya, be prepared to pay a high price. The demand for their work is
                very high, and there are only a limited number of artists. Many people are willing to pay a premium for
                an artist's work, so the prices can be quite expensive.
